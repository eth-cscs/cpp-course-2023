# Why care about memory layout?

| Year         | Processor| Cores | Memory | GFLOPS | Bandwidth | Ratio |
|--------------|-----------|------------|--------------|-----------|------------|---|
| **1998** | Intel P2 Xeon 400| 1x 400 MHz | DDR-200 | 0.2 | 1.6 GBps | **0.125 FLOPS/Bps** |
| **2022** | AMD Ryzen 9 7950X | 16x 5.0 GHz | DDR5-5200 | 1280 | 41.6 GBps | **30.77 FLOPS/Bps** |

In the past 25 years:
- Compute performance grew ~6000x
- Memory bandwidth only grew ~30x

Consequence:
- Applications can easily get memory bound
- Performant applications must use memory efficiently
- Efficient memory use requires careful design


---

# What is data-oriented design (DoD)?

- Think about your program as a graph of transforms
- Each transform takes some data as input and produces some other data
- Lay out your data in memory such that it's *efficient* to do the transforms

# Theory: memory hierarchy of modern systems

| Memory | Technology | Latency | Bandwidth | Price |
|--------------|-----------|------------|--------------|---|
| Registers | SRAM | < 1 cycle | - | $$$ |
| L1 cache | SRAM | 4 cycles | 1 TB/s | $$$ |
| L2 cache | SRAM | 16 cycles | 1 TB/s | $$$ |
| L3 cache | SRAM | 160 cycles | 400 GB/s | $$$ |
| DDR5 SDRAM | DRAM | 320 cycles | 40 GB/s | $$ |
| SSD | NAND flash | > 4000 cycles | 7 GB/s | $ |

- Many levels of storage until data reaches the CPU
- Want to keep "hot" data in fast storage
- Want to exploit strengths of storage technology

# Theory: operation of DRAM

- The organization and operation of DDR SDRAM is quite complex, we'll have a simplified view
- Reading procedure:
    1. Select the address you want to read
    2. Wait until the DRAM serves you the data - this can take a while
    3. Read out requested data (32, 64 or 128 bits at once)
    4. Read the next address:
        - Reading from nearby locations is quick
        - If reading from elsewhere you have to wait again until you get the data
- Burst mode:
    - You would normally get 64 bits of data
    - The DRAM can give you 8 consecutive blocks of 64 bits too
    - You don't need to wait between the 8 data packets, they come quickly after each other (in a *burst*)
    - That makes chunks of 8x 64 bits == 64 bytes being read at once
- Pretty much the same goes for writes

---

# Lesson #1: buy one, get 64 (1)

How to **use DRAM poorly**:
- Let's take a huge array of `int64`s and sum every 8th element
- This uses the first 8 bytes of a 64 byte burst

```c++
int64_t sum_every_8th(std::span<int64_t> values) {
    int64_t sum = 0;
    for (size_t idx = 0; idx < (values.size() & ~7u); idx += 8) {
        // Pick first element out of a block of 8.
        sum += values[idx + 0];
    }
    return sum;
}
```

---

# Lesson #1: buy one, get 64 (2)

How to **use DRAM well**:
- Let's take a huge array of `int64`s and sum all elements
- This uses all 64 bytes of a 64 byte burst

```c++
int64_t sum_all(std::span<int64_t> values) {
    int64_t sum = 0;
    for (size_t idx = 0; idx < (values.size() & ~7u); idx += 8) {
        // Pairwise sum of all elements in a block of 8.
        sum += ((values[idx + 0] + values[idx + 1]) + (values[idx + 2] + values[idx + 3]))
               + ((values[idx + 4] + values[idx + 5]) + (values[idx + 6] + values[idx + 7]));
    }
    return sum;
}
```

# Lesson #1: buy one, get 64 (3)

**Question: how does the execution time of the two algorithms compare?** You can assume they both get the same input.
- (a) **Every 8th element faster**
- (b) **Equal**
- (c) **All elements faster**

**Make your bets!**

---

# Lesson #1: buy one, get 64 (4)

Results on my system:
```
sum all:       1130 ms, 37.9886  GiB/s
sum every 8th:  937 ms,  5.72767 GiB/s
```

*The theoretical maximum bandwidth of my computer is 53.6 GiB/s, so the benchmark was really (mostly) memory bound.*

**Answer: they run in (essentially) equal time.** We've requested 8 bytes, but we got 64 for free. The arithmetic we did on the free bytes was mostly hidden.

**Takeaway**: look at your calculation (*transform*), group together all data it uses, put data it doesn't use elsewhere. **You can't read a single byte from DRAM, you always read at least 64 bytes!**

**Note**: the tests eliminate the effect of CPU caching and prefetching as much as possible.

# Lesson #2: reads vs. block size (1)

Test method:
- Allocate a huge chunk of memory
- Split it into blocks of equal size
- Read bursts from each block, then change the block
    - We can read a block from start to end, linearly
    - We can randomly permute the accesses [start, end)
- No address is read twice all throughout -- we measure pure DRAM, not cache
- Explicitly prefetch addresses (explained later) -- we measure DRAM, not HW prefetcher

# Lesson #2: reads vs. block size (3)

- Sequential access is much faster (40 GB/s) than randomized access (16 GB/s)
- Sequential access:
    - The larger the block size, the better the bandwidth
- Randomized access:
    - Small and large block sizes are equally slow, the sweet spot is at 256*64 bytes
    - Explanation: DRAM is organized in rows and columns, and while changing a column is cheap, changing a row is expensive. The sweet spot corresponds to the fewest row changes, which likely explains the performance increase there.

**Question**: if column changes should have a very small cost, why does randomized access not peak at 40 GB/s? *The answer is left as an exercise to the reader.*

**Takeaway**: randomized access to the DRAM appears to be 3-4 times slower than sequential access, make sure to access memory in regular patterns and large contiguous blocks.

**Note**: the tests eliminate the effect of CPU caching and prefetching as much as possible.

# Theory: CPU cache hierarchy

Modern CPUs typically emply 3 levels of caching:
| Memory | Typical size | Count | Description |
|--------------|------|-----|------------|
| Registers | 64 bit | Many per core | The CPU can readily do arithmetic & logic only on registers. |
| **L1 cache** | ~64 kB | 1 per core | Small, ultra-fast memory, each CPU core has a dedicated instance. |
| **L2 cache** | ~1 MB | 1 per core | Very fast memory, each CPU core has a dedicated instance. |
| **L3 cache** | ~32 MB | 1 per package | Fast memory, this one is shared accross all CPU cores. |
| DRAM | 32 GB | 1-4 channels |  |

# Theory: cached memory reads

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Goal**: bring 1 byte from DRAM into a register

**Procedure**:
1. Check if data is in L1 cache
2. Check if data is in L2 cache
3. Check if data is in L3 cache
4. Get data from DRAM
5. Insert data into L3 cache (+ address & metadata)
6. Insert data into L2 cache
7. Insert data into L1 cache
8. Write data into register

**Making space** : old data will be removed from the cache so that new can be inserted

</div>
<div>

**Cache hit**:
- If the data is found in any of the L1-L3 caches, we have a *cache hit*
- In that case, data is retrieved from there and written into the register, and the procedure terminates

**Cache miss**:
- If data is *NOT* found in the L? cache, we talk about an *L? cache miss*
- In that case, the procedure continues by checking the next cache level

</div>
</div>

---

# Theory: cached memory writes

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Goal**: move 1 byte from register to DRAM

**Procedure**:
1. Read data from register
2. Insert data into L1 cache
</div>
<div>

**When is data actually written into DRAM?**
- Each piece of data written to L1 like this is flagged as *updated*
- When space in L1 is reclaimed, *updated* data gets written back to L2
- When space in L2 is reclaimed, the data again gets written back to L3 and then finally the DRAM

</div>
</div>

---

# Theory: cache entries

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Cache lines**:
- Data in the caches is organized into so-called *cache lines*
- A cache line is typically 64 bytes (same as DRAM burst length, but could be different)
- Each cache entry stores
  - The data of the cache line
  - The memory address of the data
  - Information about the data (e.g. valid, updated, etc.)

</div>
<div>

**Replacement policies**:
- Once the cache is full, we cannot put more entries in it
- We must remove some entries to free up space
- Which entry should we remove?
  - Many strategies
  - Most practical is the *least recently used (LRU)* algorithm, or some variations of it

</div>
</div>

---

# Theory: cache coherence

**Problem**: CPU #1 and #2 write, while #3 reads the same memory location simultaneously. What happens?

**Solution**: memory accesses are serialized internally by the CPU, regardless of the initiating core:
1. CPU #1 writes data into its own L1 cache and invalidates this address in all other caches
2. CPU #2 writes data into its own L1 cache and invalidates this address in all other caches
3. CPU #3 reads address that is cached in CPU #2's L1 cache
    - As a result data is flushed to the shared L3 cache
    - CPU #3 retrieves the data from the L3 cache

**Practical implementations**: there are different methods to implement cache coherence in modern, multi-core CPUs. We will not examine exact implementations, as it's not strictly necessary to understand the main principles.

# Lesson #3: keep frequently accessed data in caches (1)

Test method:
- Allocate a memory block of certain size
- Keep reading that block repeatedly
- This should keep the block in cache if it fits
- Observe performance

# Lesson #3: keep frequently accessed data in caches (2)


<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Results**:

<img src="./images/cache_block_size.svg" alt="cache_block_size" title="" width="100%"/> 

</div>
<div>

**Explanation**:

- We see a dip in performance at 512 KiB of data
    - The data becomes too big to fit in L2
    - Must use slower L3 cache
- We see a dip at 64 MiB too
    - The data becomes too big to fit in L3
    - Must use slower DRAM
- What about L1 and a dip at 32 KiB?
    - Maybe we are already be ALU-bound
    - Maybe L1 doesn't have any higher bandwidth (may still have lower latency though!)

**Takeaway**: If you repeatadly access the same data, try to make sure it fits in the fastest cache available.

</div>
</div>

# Lesson #4: false sharing is not caring (1)

- Remember *cache lines*?
    - All the physical memory is split into cache lines
    - You cannot pull just part of a cache line into the caches
- What if two CPU cores read-modify-write the same cache line?
    - The writes normally go into each CPUs local L1 cache
    - Coherence: concurrent reads force the written data to be flushed into L3
    - **False sharing**: The CPUs don't have to write the exact same address, it's enough if the addresses share a cache line.
    - **Example**: You have an `std::array<int, 2> a;`, one CPU core is updating `a[0]` while the other is updating `a[1]`. Since the two elements (almost always) share a cache line, this results in false sharing.
    - **Note**: the CPUs don't actually share any data, this is why it's called *false* sharing.

---

# Lesson #4: false sharing is not caring (2)

So how bad is false sharing?

**Test method**:
- Take a large array of numbers
- Split it into batches
- Sum each batch in a new thread
- Sum the partial results
- **False sharing**: put each thread's accumulator in the same cache line!

---

# Lesson #4: false sharing is not caring (3)


<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Results**:

| Number of threads | Time clean | Time false sharing |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 297 ms | 300 ms |
| 2 | 177 ms | 1563 ms |
| 3 | 158 ms | 1721 ms |
| 4 | 161 ms | 6322 ms |
| 5 | 157 ms | 8295 ms |
| 6 | 158 ms | 3374 ms |
| 7 | 157 ms | 4810 ms |
| 8 | 158 ms | 6082 ms |


</div>
<div>

**Explanation**:
- One thread cannot have false sharing, times are virtually the same
- Clean: no speedup beyond 2 CPU cores, at that point it's already memory bound
- False sharing: performance severly impacted by all the synchronization between CPU cores

**Note**: this is a made-up example for demonstration purposes. False sharing most often occurs with lockless data structures relying on atomics.

**Takeaway**: make sure not to put independent resources that are written by multiple threads into the same cache line. Performance can be affected drastically.

# Theory: the prefetcher (1)

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Imagine the scenario**:
- Application: CPU, give me `a[4]` and `b[4]`!
- CPU: Okay, **please wait 50 ns**, DRAM is slow
- Application: ...
- CPU: Here is `a[4]` and `b[4]`
- Application: CPU, add `a[4]` and `b[4]`!
- CPU: Here is `a[4]` + `b[4]`
- Application: CPU, give me `a[5]` and `b[5]`!
- CPU: Okay, **please wait 50 ns**, DRAM is slow
- ...

</div>
<div>

**What if instead we had this**:

- Application: CPU, give me `a[4]` and `b[4]`!
- CPU: Okay, **please wait 50 ns**, DRAM is slow
- (CPU: **I bet he's gonna get** `a[5]` and `b[5]` next, better request it now.)
- Application: ...
- CPU: Here is `a[4]` and `b[4]`
- Application: CPU, add `a[4]` and `b[4]`!
- CPU: Here is `a[4]` + `b[4]`
- Application: CPU, give me `a[5]` and `b[5]`!
- CPU: I expected you to want it, **here is** `a[4]` + `b[4]`
- ...

</div>
</div>

# Theory: the prefetcher (2)

- In fact, this is how modern CPUs actually work
- They try to predict memory access patterns and move data to cache even before it's requested

# Lesson #5: make use of the prefetcher (1)

You can do it in two ways:
1. Access memory in predictable patterns
    - Sequential access is always a good idea
    - Otherwise, measure
2. Issue explicit `PREFETCHT0` or similar instructions
    - Not super portable
    - Be careful not to make things worse


---

# Lesson #5: make use of the prefetcher (2)

- Remember our reads within differently sized blocks test?
- I used `PREFETCHT0` all throughout, what if we remove it?

# Lesson #5: make use of the prefetcher (3)

**Results**:
- Performance somewhat affected for sequential reads
    - The CPU's hardware prefetcher does a good job
    - My manual prefetch probably has a longer look-ahead
- Performance drastically affected for random reads
    - The CPU's hardware prefetcher is basically useless here

**Takeaway**: 
Play your data into the hands of the hardware prefetcher. If you can't, consider using manual prefetching.

# Practical memory handling in C++ (1)

## Overaligned memory

**Alignment:** memory address of a variable must be a multiple of X bytes.

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**Why?**
- SIMD types: aligned load and store may be faster
- Align to cache lines: to avoid false sharing
- GPU memory: may help texture units or texture cache

</div>
<div>

**How?**
- `alignof` keyword: like `sizeof`, but gives you the alignment
- `alignas` keyword: specified the alignment of a type/object
- `std::aligned_alloc`: like `malloc`, but with specific alignment
- `operator new` / `operator delete`: can now handle overaligned types

</div>
</div>

---

# Practical memory handling in C++ (2)

## Overaligned memory: example

Consider a vector class suitable for SSE:
```c++
struct Vec4 {
    alignas(16) float elements[4];
};;
```

Now you may safely use aligned loads and stores:
```c++
Vec4 v; // Our custom vector type
const auto reg1 = _mm_load_ps(v.elements); // aligned, always fast
const auto reg2 = _mm_loadu_ps(v.elements); // unaligned, may be slower
```

Dynammically allocating `Vec4`s also respects the alignment specification:
```c++
auto* const vectors = new Vector[1337];
delete[] vectors;
```

---

# Practical memory handling in C++ (3)

## Cache lines

- The size of cache lines may be different on different hardware
- Luckily, C++ has:
    - `std::hardware_destructive_interference`: *minimum offset between two objects to avoid false sharing"* (from cppreference)
    - `std::hardware_constructive_interference`: *"maximum size of contiguous memory to promote true sharing"* (from cppreference)
- Unfortunately...
    - They are not supported in libstdc++
    - You have to #ifdef them to a fallback value in reality

---

# Remarks

- There have been announcments that OOP is dead...
- Data oriented design is just another tool

**Can I still use OOP?**
- Yes, and you should
- It's very intuitive and often help with clean code

**When to use DoD?**
- When it improves your performance
- Sometimes it even makes your code cleaner!

**Are DoD and OOP exclusive?**
- No, you can mix them as you see fit

Performance and readability are two different goals, and often one is traded for the other.
