C++ is an object-oriented programming language that among its main selling points has

- üèéÔ∏è Performances
- üéõÔ∏è Letting the user have full control over resources

**Performance** and **full-control** are somehow faces of the same coin: full control allows to do very clever and smart things to get best performances.

# Example: Memory

Memory management is an important aspects for many application, be it for
+ for optimization reasons
e.g.reduce memory operations costs and overhead)
+ memory limit constraints
e.g. embedded applications

This is one of the reasons why C++ is used in many industries, from Game Development to HPC.

Anywhere performance and control matters.

Indeed, C++ gives you all the knobs to manage the memory: when to allocate, when to deallocate, how much to allocate, ...

# It's not just about memory<br/>... it's about RESOURCEs!

Full control of a resource means managing it correctly by

Managing the lifetime of a resource in an object-oriented context easily becomes difficult.

- objects are created,
- objects are manipulated
- objects are passed around to interact with other parts of the program
- ...

When the program complexity starts increasing, to ensure the correct management of these resources ‚Äúmanually‚Äù becomes unsustainable.

...and with concurrency it becomes even more difficult (**="impossible"** ü§Ø).

# Full control $\not\equiv$ hard to do!

Some languages address this problem using **garbage collectors**
but at the expense of performances and control.

**Not a solution for C++...**

...but having full control does not imply having to do it manually!

The language, through the compiler, is at our disposal. We can and should leverage it at our service.

Here we are going to see what tools the language offers us and which we can and should rely on to keep things under control, aiming at

**READABLE**, **CORRECT** and **EFFICIENT** code.

# RAII

**RAII**, which stands for *Resource Allocation Is Initialization*, is a programming technique that binds resource acquisition to **object lifetime**.

If an object follows RAII, it ensures that:
+ the resource is acquired/allocated/initialized when the object is initialised
+ it will be available for the lifetime of the object
+ and when the object is destroyed (it goes out of scope) the binded resource will be released too.

</div>

---
<div class="hcenter">

# Ownership

With RAII an object starts representing the **ownership** of the resource, so object has the responsibility of the correct management.

Developer does not have anymore the "direct" responsibility of the resource, but it does not mean they don‚Äôt have anymore control over it.

We delegated the hard-work of managing correctly the resource to the object and we can now reason about its ownership.

It‚Äôs a higher level of control, we don‚Äôt care anymore about what happens when the resource has to be created/released, we just have to think where and how long we need the resource and manipulate the object accordingly.

# Raw Pointers

Every C and C++ developer had to overcome the obstacle of pointers...

    int* buffer = new int[13];

        int val = vec[i];

# Object Lifetime - C'tor and D'tor

RAII binds a resource to object lifetime.

Let's see what are the main handles we have on object lifetime.

```c++
{
    LessRawPtr a;       // c'tor is called

    // ...
}                       // d'tor is called
```

The language gives us the handle to the moment when an object starts is lifetime through its <mark>**constructor**</mark>!

**And what happen when it goes out of scope?** It gets destroyed...and the language gives us the chance to customize what happens at destruction time through its <mark>**destructor**</mark>!

# Object Lifetime

```cpp
struct LessRawPtr {
    LessRawPtr() = default;
    LessRawPtr(int* ptr) : ptr_(ptr) {}

</div>
</div>

**The real magic ü™Ñ resides in the d'tor part**. It gets called as soon as an object lifetime ends:

+ it goes out of scope (e.g. block, expression, ...)
+ stack unwinding, i.e. when an exception is uncaught

We are binding a resource with an object on the *stack*, so **we are transitively giving properties of an *object on the stack* to a *resource***!

# RAII ‚úÖ - Ownerhsip ‚ùì

Now the lifetime of the resource is bound to the object, thanks to RAII. And what about ownership?

+ **What does it mean "ownership" for an object?**
It means that an object has responsibility over the underlying resource, whatever it happens...
+ **What can happen to an object?**
We can pass it around, for instance we can copy it!
+ **What happens when we copy an object?**
From the language perspective, a new object is created...
+ **...and what should happen from the resource perspective?**
It depends!

<center>

**Does the language provide an handle for this phases of the object life?**

</center>

---
# `T(const T&)` and `T& operator=(const T&)`

+ **Did we specify anything about them?** Nope.
+ **What happens?** Default behavior of the language.

The language cannot know aforehead how the object should behave, so it does the most simple thing.

It implicitly defines them (`= default`)
+ D'tor does nothing, i.e. empty body
+ Copy-{C'tor, Assigment Operator}, copy by value all attributes

<div class="twocolumns">
<div>

**What does it mean in our case?** `LessRawPtr` has a single attribute `ptr_`, which is a simple pointer, so it means copying the address into another object.

# Rule of Three

![bg right](./attachments/three.png)

If a class requires either a:
+ user-defined d'tor
`~LessRawPtr()`
+ user-defined copy c'tor
`LessRawPtr(const LessRawPtr&)`
+ user-defined copy assignment operator
`LessRawPtr& operator=(const LessRawPtr&)`

it almost certainly requires all three.

---
# What to do? It depends!

What *copy-{c'tor,assignment}* should do depends on how the object should behave on copy (*object semantic*) with respect to the controlled resource.

It might be:
- clone (aka "deep-copy")
should it allocate another identical and independent resource and copy its value?
- not-copyable
should it just not being copiable at all? (`= delete`)
- something else?
there might be other possible behaviors

<center>

Whatever you want it to do, you have to define it. ü§ì

**What do we have?** An object representing ownership of a memory allocation. This last implementation is not copyable, so the ownership of the resource is exclusive and cannot be transferred in any way.

# Ownership

`LessRawPtr` is really a partial implementation, to the extent that it cannot be really defined a pointer (e.g. how do I access the memory in it?!) and it would need some extensions in order to make it useful.

But it already expresses the concept of **ownership**!

It is possible to differentiate mainly two types of ownership:
- **Unique (or exclusive) ownership**
when there is exactly one object instance managing a specific resource
- **Shared ownership**
when there are more objects managing the same resource (not clones, but exactly the same resource).

This is copyable, and the copyability for it has been implemented not to clone the resource but to "share" the resource, allowing to extend the ownership group.

As we trivially saw before, just copying the address was not enough for sharing correctly the same resource over two objects. The main problem was that once the address was copied, the two objects were not "linked" anyhow, so one didn't know if the other was still using the resource or not.

    Dataset(const Dataset&) {
        std::cout << "Create dataset copying GBs of data\n";

    Dataset& operator=(const Dataset&) {
        std::cout << "Copying GBs of data\n";
        return *this;
    }
    void initialize() {
        std::cout << "Initialize dataset...\n";
    }
};
```

The semantic of this object is:
+ Default C'tor create a dataset
+ Data inside a dataset can be deep-copied

</div>

---
<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
Dataset a;
Dataset b;
b = a;
```

```
Created dataset!
Created dataset!
Copying GBs of data
Deleting dataset!
Deleting dataset!
```

üëç Perfectly fine with it!

Two datasets created, one copy, two datasets destroyed.

‚úÖ Nothing unexpected.

</div>

---
<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
Dataset createDataset() {
    Dataset x;
    x.initialize();
    return x;
}

Dataset b = createDataset();
```

```
Created dataset!
Initialize dataset...
Deleting dataset!
```

ü§î I would have expected:
+ Two datasets created (`x` default, `b` copied)
+ Two dataset destroyed

</div>

<center>

Wow! No copy?!?  Indeed, there is no copy: it does not call the copy-c'tor! Thanks to **copy-elision**! 

### C++ IS SUPER! BEST PERFORMANCE!

</center>

---
<div class="hcenter">

# Copy elision

<cite>

"(copy-elision) omits copy [...] **constructor**, resulting in zero-copy pass-by-value semantics." </cite>

</cite>

```cpp
Dataset b = createDataset();
```

**Is it a copy-constructor or a copy-assignment?**

The copy assignment is a member function, so it has to be applied to an existing object.
But at this point the object does not exist yet, so even if it looks like an assignment, it is actually a constructor call, a copy-c'tor call!

*Ok, from the code we expect a copy constructor call, and copy elision explicitly refers to the constructor and not to the assignment operator...*

</div>

---
<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
Dataset createDataset() {
    Dataset x;
    x.initialize();
    return x;
}
Dataset b;
b = createDataset();
```

```
Created dataset!
Created dataset!
Initialize dataset...
Copying GBs of data
Deleting dataset!
Deleting dataset!
```

No copy-elision at the party, and performance are gone!

...is it so different than before?! A temporary dataset is created and, instead of using that (as in copy-elision case), it gets copied from, just before discarding it?!

</div>

<center>

### C++ is stupid! Why can't it use temporary one also here?!

</center>

---

# Why is it so stupid?!

It is not stupid, it just let you decide all details!

<center>

### Remember: With C++ you have FULL CONTROL!

</center>

So here there is the plot-twist...you have control also over this specific case!

**Can you spot the difference between the twos?** We were talking about a "temporary"...

<div class="twocolumns">

<div>

<center>

"deep-copy"

</center>

```cpp
Dataset b;
b = a;
```
</div>

<div>

<center>

"no copy-elision"

</center>

```cpp
Dataset b;
b = createDataset();
```
</div>

</div>

**Can you see it?** The main difference is that the temporary does not have a name!

<center>

### Yes, C++ gives a knob also for this!

</center>

But, before seeing the handle, let's understand a bit better this question about temporaries...

---

# In the beginning there was just LEFT and RIGHT...

Even if they are not 100% correct, these definitions are very good approximations.

+ `lvalue`s can stay **<mark>"typically"</mark>** on the **left** side of `=`, and `rvalues` can **<mark>"typically"</mark>** stay on the **right**.
+ `lvalue` is **<mark>"typically"</mark>** something with an **identity**, and `rvalue` has **<mark>"typically"</mark>** **no identity**

For them, the language offers two different kind of references that binds to them.

+ `&` lvalue references
+ `&&` rvalue references

<center>
An important detail:
<cite>

`&&` (rvalue reference), extend lifetime of temporaries. Also `const&` (const lvalue reference) does.

</cite>
</center>

---
# Back to our performance problem...

Let's try to express our desired behavior in terms of `lvalues` and `rvalues`.

<div class="twocolumns">

<div>

```cpp
Dataset b;
b = a;
```
</div>

<div>

```cpp
Dataset b;
b = createDataset();
```
</div>

</div>

Desiderata:
+ we don't want to steal from an `lvalue`, because it is not a temporary and someone else might still use it
+ we might want to steal from an `rvalue`, because it is a temporary and it is going to be destroyed

We used the word "steal", because a temporary object can get completely emptied. In C++ it is used the word "move", from which it origins the **move-semantic**, meaning that the "ownership" of a resource can be moved from one object to another.

---
<div class="hcenter">

# What handles do we have?

Let's give another look at references that binds to `lvalues` and `rvalues`:

`lvalue` -> `&`
`rvalue` -> `&&`

Actually, in the **<mark>copy c'tor</mark>** and in the **<mark>copy assignment operator</mark>** we use the `const&`, which is an `lvalue` reference...

<center>

`Dataset(const Dataset&)` and `Dataset& operator=(const Dataset&)`

**What if we use an rvalue reference instead of an lvalue one?**

`Dataset(Dataset&&)` and `Dataset& operator=(Dataset&&)`

We get a **<mark>move c'tor</mark>** and a **<mark>move assignment operator</mark>**!

</center>

---
<div class="hcenter">

<!-- https://godbolt.org/z/qhrT1xfhr -->

```cpp
struct Dataset {
    Dataset() {
        std::cout << "Created dataset!\n";
    };
    ~Dataset() {
        std::cout << "Deleting dataset!\n";
    }
    Dataset(const Dataset&) {
        std::cout << "Create dataset copying GBs of data\n";
    }
    Dataset& operator=(const Dataset&) {
        std::cout << "Copying GBs of data\n";
        return *this;
    }
    Dataset(Dataset&&) {
        std::cout << "Stole dataset\n";
    }
    Dataset& operator=(Dataset&&) {
        std::cout << "Stole dataset\n";
        return *this;
    }
    void initialize() {
        std::cout << "Initialize dataset...\n";
    }
};
```

Now `Dataset` is able to behave differently depending on the value category of the argument:
+ `lvalue` -> copy c'tor or copy assignment operator
+ `rvalue` -> move c'tor or move assignment operator

</div>

---
<!-- _class: lead -->

<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
Dataset b;
b = createDataset();
```

```
Created dataset!
Created dataset!
Initialize dataset...
Stole dataset
Deleting dataset!
Deleting dataset!
```

Now the temporary gets stolen during the assignment.

### Performance are back!

# Rule of Five
![bg right:33%](./attachments/five.png)

<cite>

Because the presence of a user-defined (or `= default` or `= delete`)
+ D'tor
+ Copy C'tor
+ Copy Assignment Operator

**any class for which move semantics are desirable**, has to declare:
</cite>

1. D'tor
2. Copy c'tor
3. Copy assignment
4. Move c'tor
5. Move assignment

**Unlike Rule of Three, failing to implement move semantic is not an error, but a missed optimization opportunity.**

---
# This is just a part of the story...

We might want to move resources also from an `lvalue`, because we know it is going to be destroyed soon or it is not going to be used anymore.

C++ gives us an handle also for this! We can "move" ownership also from an `lvalue` with `std::move()`!

<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
Dataset a;
Dataset b;
b = std::move(a);
```

```
Created dataset!
Created dataset!
Stole dataset
Deleting dataset!
Deleting dataset!
```

</div>

Note: When you call `std::move(a)`, after that call you cannot assume anything about `a`. It is in a *valid but unspecified state*.

---

# `std::move` DOES NOT move

`std::move` tells that you "might move from" the object, but actually it does not move anything.

The "move" of the resources is up to the function that gets the `rvalue` reference, it might also not doing anything with it or just reading from it.

Indeed, `std::move` is just an unconditional cast from an lvalue reference to an rvalue reference!

<center>

### It makes an `lvalue` appear like an `rvalue`!

</center>

Actually, the implementation is something very similar to this simplified snippet

<div class="hcenter">

```cpp
T&& std::move(T& lvalue) {
    return static_cast<T&&>(lvalue);
}
```

</div>

<center>

*See actual LLVM libc++ implementation @
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/libc/src/__support/CPP/utility/move.h*

<div class="hcenter">

From https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/reference

<cite>

When a function's return type is lvalue reference, the function call expression becomes an lvalue expression:

</cite>

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
 
char& char_number(std::string& s, std::size_t n) {
    return s.at(n);
}
 
int main()
{

    char_number(str, 1) = 'a';
    std::cout << str << '\n';

![bg left:33%](./attachments/zero.png)
# Rule of Zero

Classes that have:
+ custom destructors
+ copy/move constructors or
+ copy/move assignment operators

**should deal exclusively with ownership**
(which follows from the Single Responsibility Principle).

<mark>

**Other classes should not have custom destructors, copy/move constructors or copy/move assignment operators.**

### What about applying RuleOf0??

<center>

# RuleOf0 rocks!

Actually we can use `std::unique_ptr` to express what kind of ownership we want to have for our object.

<center>

It's generic, it's reusable!

<div class="twocolumns">

    void* get() const noexcept { return context_.get(); }

    private:
    std::unique_ptr<void, decltype(&zmq_ctx_destroy)> context_;
};

struct ZmqSocket {
    ZmqSocket(void* handle) : socket_(handle, zmq_close) {}
    void* get() const noexcept { return socket_.get(); }

    private:
    std::unique_ptr<void, decltype(&zmq_close)> socket_;

##### In the end it is just
# RuleOf0 vs RuleOf5

</center>

In modern C++ (>=C++11), where move-semantic has been introduced, RuleOf3 has pratically been superseeded by RuleOf5.

Moreover, as we have seen, STL provides generic objects encapsulating ownership policies, e.g. `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, allowing us to completely relying on them for the management.

<center>

For this reason the guideline is
